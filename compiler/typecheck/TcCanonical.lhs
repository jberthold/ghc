Note [Canonicalisation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Converts (Constraint f) _which_does_not_contain_proper_implications_ to CanonicalCts
* Unary: treats individual constraints one at a time
* Does not do any zonking
* Lives in TcS monad so that it can create new skolem variables

Note [Flattening]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  flatten ty  ==>   (xi, cc)
    where
      xi has no type functions
      cc = Auxiliary given (equality) constraints constraining
           the fresh type variables in xi.  Evidence for these 
           is always the identity coercion, because internally the
           fresh flattening skolem variables are actually identified
           with the types they have been generated to stand in for.

Note that it is flatten's job to flatten *every type function it sees*.
flatten is only called on *arguments* to type functions, by canEqGiven.

Recall that in comments we use alpha[flat = ty] to represent a
flattening skolem variable alpha which has been generated to stand in
for ty.

----- Example of flattening a constraint: ------
  flatten (List (F (G Int)))  ==>  (xi, cc)
    where
      xi  = List alpha
      cc  = { G Int ~ beta[flat = G Int],
              F beta ~ alpha[flat = F beta] }
Here
  * alpha and beta are 'flattening skolem variables'.
  * All the constraints in cc are 'given', and all their coercion terms 
    are the identity.

NB: Flattening Skolems only occur in canonical constraints, which
are never zonked, so we don't need to worry about zonking doing
accidental unflattening.

Note that we prefer to leave type synonyms unexpanded when possible,
so when the flattener encounters one, it first asks whether its
transitive expansion contains any type function applications.  If so,
it expands the synonym and proceeds; if not, it simply returns the
unexpanded synonym.

TODO: caching the information about whether transitive synonym
expansions contain any type function applications would speed things
up a bit; right now we waste a lot of energy traversing the same types
multiple times.

Note [Adding superclasses]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Since dictionaries are canonicalized only once in their lifetime, the
place to add their superclasses is canonicalisation (The alternative
would be to do it during constraint solving, but we'd have to be
extremely careful to not repeatedly introduced the same superclass in
our worklist). Here is what we do:

For Givens: 
       We add all their superclasses as Givens. 

For Wanteds: 
       Generally speaking we want to be able to add superclasses of 
       wanteds for two reasons:

       (1) Oportunities for improvement. Example: 
                  class (a ~ b) => C a b 
           Wanted constraint is: C alpha beta 
           We'd like to simply have C alpha alpha. Similar 
           situations arise in relation to functional dependencies. 
           
       (2) To have minimal constraints to quantify over: 
           For instance, if our wanted constraint is (Eq a, Ord a) 
           we'd only like to quantify over Ord a. 

       To deal with (1) above we only add the superclasses of wanteds
       which may lead to improvement, that is: equality superclasses or 
       superclasses with functional dependencies. 

       We deal with (2) completely independently in TcSimplify. See 
       Note [Minimize by SuperClasses] in TcSimplify. 


       Moreover, in all cases the extra improvement constraints are 
       Derived. Derived constraints have an identity (for now), but 
       we don't do anything with their evidence. For instance they 
       are never used to rewrite other constraints. 

       See also [New Wanted Superclass Work] in TcInteract. 


For Deriveds: 
       We do nothing.

Here's an example that demonstrates why we chose to NOT add
superclasses during simplification: [Comes from ticket #4497]
 
   class Num (RealOf t) => Normed t
   type family RealOf x

Assume the generated wanted constraint is: 
   RealOf e ~ e, Normed e 
If we were to be adding the superclasses during simplification we'd get: 
   Num uf, Normed e, RealOf e ~ e, RealOf e ~ uf 
==> 
   e ~ uf, Num uf, Normed e, RealOf e ~ e 
==> [Spontaneous solve] 
   Num uf, Normed uf, RealOf uf ~ uf 

While looks exactly like our original constraint. If we add the superclass again we'd loop. 
By adding superclasses definitely only once, during canonicalisation, this situation can't 
happen.

Note [Naked given applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider: 
   data A a 
   type T a = A a 
and the given equality:  
   [G] A a ~ T Int 
We will reach the case canEq where we do a tcSplitAppTy_maybe, but if
we dont have the guards (Nothing <- tcView ty1) (Nothing <- tcView
ty2) then the given equation is going to fall through and get
completely forgotten!

What we want instead is this clause to apply only when there is no
immediate top-level synonym; if there is one it will be later on
unfolded by the later stages of canEq.

Test-case is in typecheck/should_compile/GivenTypeSynonym.hs


Note [Equality between type applications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If we see an equality of the form s1 t1 ~ s2 t2 we can always split
it up into s1 ~ s2 /\ t1 ~ t2, since s1 and s2 can't be type
functions (type functions use the TyConApp constructor, which never
shows up as the LHS of an AppTy).  Other than type functions, types
in Haskell are always 

  (1) generative: a b ~ c d implies a ~ c, since different type
      constructors always generate distinct types

  (2) injective: a b ~ a d implies b ~ d; we never generate the
      same type from different type arguments.


Note [Canonical ordering for equality constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implemented as (<+=) below:

  - Type function applications always come before anything else.  
  - Variables always come before non-variables (other than type
      function applications).

Note that we don't need to unfold type synonyms on the RHS to check
the ordering; that is, in the rules above it's OK to consider only
whether something is *syntactically* a type function application or
not.  To illustrate why this is OK, suppose we have an equality of the
form 'tv ~ S a b c', where S is a type synonym which expands to a
top-level application of the type function F, something like

  type S a b c = F d e

Then to canonicalize 'tv ~ S a b c' we flatten the RHS, and since S's
expansion contains type function applications the flattener will do
the expansion and then generate a skolem variable for the type
function application, so we end up with something like this:

  tv ~ x
  F d e ~ x

where x is the skolem variable.  This is one extra equation than
absolutely necessary (we could have gotten away with just 'F d e ~ tv'
if we had noticed that S expanded to a top-level type function
application and flipped it around in the first place) but this way
keeps the code simpler.

Unlike the OutsideIn(X) draft of May 7, 2010, we do not care about the
ordering of tv ~ tv constraints.  There are several reasons why we
might:

  (1) In order to be able to extract a substitution that doesn't
      mention untouchable variables after we are done solving, we might
      prefer to put touchable variables on the left. However, in and
      of itself this isn't necessary; we can always re-orient equality
      constraints at the end if necessary when extracting a substitution.

  (2) To ensure termination we might think it necessary to put
      variables in lexicographic order. However, this isn't actually 
      necessary as outlined below.

While building up an inert set of canonical constraints, we maintain
the invariant that the equality constraints in the inert set form an
acyclic rewrite system when viewed as L-R rewrite rules.  Moreover,
the given constraints form an idempotent substitution (i.e. none of
the variables on the LHS occur in any of the RHS's, and type functions
never show up in the RHS at all), the wanted constraints also form an
idempotent substitution, and finally the LHS of a given constraint
never shows up on the RHS of a wanted constraint.  There may, however,
be a wanted LHS that shows up in a given RHS, since we do not rewrite
given constraints with wanted constraints.

Suppose we have an inert constraint set


  tg_1 ~ xig_1         -- givens
  tg_2 ~ xig_2
  ...
  tw_1 ~ xiw_1         -- wanteds
  tw_2 ~ xiw_2
  ...

where each t_i can be either a type variable or a type function
application. Now suppose we take a new canonical equality constraint,
t' ~ xi' (note among other things this means t' does not occur in xi')
and try to react it with the existing inert set.  We show by induction
on the number of t_i which occur in t' ~ xi' that this process will
terminate.

There are several ways t' ~ xi' could react with an existing constraint:

TODO: finish this proof.  The below was for the case where the entire
inert set is an idempotent subustitution...

(b) We could have t' = t_j for some j.  Then we obtain the new
    equality xi_j ~ xi'; note that neither xi_j or xi' contain t_j.  We
    now canonicalize the new equality, which may involve decomposing it
    into several canonical equalities, and recurse on these.  However,
    none of the new equalities will contain t_j, so they have fewer
    occurrences of the t_i than the original equation.

(a) We could have t_j occurring in xi' for some j, with t' /=
    t_j. Then we substitute xi_j for t_j in xi' and continue.  However,
    since none of the t_i occur in xi_j, we have decreased the
    number of t_i that occur in xi', since we eliminated t_j and did not
    introduce any new ones.

@expandAway tv xi@ expands synonyms in xi just enough to get rid of
occurrences of tv, if that is possible; otherwise, it returns Nothing.
For example, suppose we have
  type F a b = [a]
Then
  expandAway b (F Int b) = Just [Int]
but
  expandAway a (F a Int) = Nothing

We don't promise to do the absolute minimum amount of expanding
necessary, but we try not to do expansions we don't need to.  We
prefer doing inner expansions first.  For example,
  type F a b = (a, Int, a, [a])
  type G b   = Char
We have
  expandAway b (F (G b)) = F Char
even though we could also expand F to get rid of b.

\begin{code}
expandAway :: TcTyVar -> Xi -> Maybe Xi
expandAway tv t@(TyVarTy tv') 
  | tv == tv' = Nothing
  | otherwise = Just t
expandAway tv xi
  | not (tv `elemVarSet` tyVarsOfType xi) = Just xi
expandAway tv (AppTy ty1 ty2) 
  = do { ty1' <- expandAway tv ty1
       ; ty2' <- expandAway tv ty2 
       ; return (mkAppTy ty1' ty2') }
-- mkAppTy <$> expandAway tv ty1 <*> expandAway tv ty2
expandAway tv (FunTy ty1 ty2)
  = do { ty1' <- expandAway tv ty1 
       ; ty2' <- expandAway tv ty2 
       ; return (mkFunTy ty1' ty2') } 
-- mkFunTy <$> expandAway tv ty1 <*> expandAway tv ty2
expandAway tv ty@(ForAllTy {}) 
  = let (tvs,rho) = splitForAllTys ty
        tvs_knds  = map tyVarKind tvs 
    in if tv `elemVarSet` tyVarsOfTypes tvs_knds then
       -- Can't expand away the kinds unless we create 
       -- fresh variables which we don't want to do at this point.
           Nothing 
       else do { rho' <- expandAway tv rho
               ; return (mkForAllTys tvs rho') }
-- For a type constructor application, first try expanding away the
-- offending variable from the arguments.  If that doesn't work, next
-- see if the type constructor is a type synonym, and if so, expand
-- it and try again.

Note [Type synonyms and canonicalization]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We treat type synonym applications as xi types, that is, they do not
count as type function applications.  However, we do need to be a bit
careful with type synonyms: like type functions they may not be
generative or injective.  However, unlike type functions, they are
parametric, so there is no problem in expanding them whenever we see
them, since we do not need to know anything about their arguments in
order to expand them; this is what justifies not having to treat them
as specially as type function applications.  The thing that causes
some subtleties is that we prefer to leave type synonym applications
*unexpanded* whenever possible, in order to generate better error
messages.

If we encounter an equality constraint with type synonym applications
on both sides, or a type synonym application on one side and some sort
of type application on the other, we simply must expand out the type
synonyms in order to continue decomposing the equality constraint into
primitive equality constraints.  For example, suppose we have

  type F a = [Int]

and we encounter the equality

  F a ~ [b]

In order to continue we must expand F a into [Int], giving us the
equality

  [Int] ~ [b]

which we can then decompose into the more primitive equality
constraint

  Int ~ b.

However, if we encounter an equality constraint with a type synonym
application on one side and a variable on the other side, we should
NOT (necessarily) expand the type synonym, since for the purpose of
good error messages we want to leave type synonyms unexpanded as much
as possible.

However, there is a subtle point with type synonyms and the occurs
check that takes place for equality constraints of the form tv ~ xi.
As an example, suppose we have

  type F a = Int

and we come across the equality constraint

  a ~ F a

This should not actually fail the occurs check, since expanding out
the type synonym results in the legitimate equality constraint a ~
Int.  We must actually do this expansion, because unifying a with F a
will lead the type checker into infinite loops later.  Put another
way, canonical equality constraints should never *syntactically*
contain the LHS variable in the RHS type.  However, we don't always
need to expand type synonyms when doing an occurs check; for example,
the constraint

  a ~ F b

is obviously fine no matter what F expands to. And in this case we
would rather unify a with F b (rather than F b's expansion) in order
to get better error messages later.

So, when doing an occurs check with a type synonym application on the
RHS, we use some heuristics to find an expansion of the RHS which does
not contain the variable from the LHS.  In particular, given

  a ~ F t1 ... tn

we first try expanding each of the ti to types which no longer contain
a.  If this turns out to be impossible, we next try expanding F
itself, and so on.

When we spot an equality arising from a functional dependency,
we now use that equality (a "wanted") to rewrite the work-item
constraint right away.  This avoids two dangers

 Danger 1: If we send the original constraint on down the pipeline
           it may react with an instance declaration, and in delicate
	   situations (when a Given overlaps with an instance) that
	   may produce new insoluble goals: see Trac #4952

 Danger 2: If we don't rewrite the constraint, it may re-react
           with the same thing later, and produce the same equality
           again --> termination worries.

To achieve this required some refactoring of FunDeps.lhs (nicer
now!).
