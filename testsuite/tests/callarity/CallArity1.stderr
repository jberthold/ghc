go2 (in case crut):
    go 2
    d 1
go2 (in function call):
    go 2
    d 1
go2 (using surrounding interesting let; 'go 2' would be good!):
    go 0
    d 0
    n 1
go2 (using surrounding boring let):
    go 2
    d 1
    z 0
two recursions (both arity 1 would be good!):
    d 0
    n 1
two recursions (semantically like the previous case):
    d 1
    n 1
