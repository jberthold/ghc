 * Generalised RTE for parallel Haskells.

 *
 * Services by this interface:
 *  - manages addressing (real) machines from (abstract) node numbers
 *  - provides startup, synchronisation, shutdown for parallel system
 *  - provides send / receive for communication between nodes

 * sends the included data (array of length length) to the indicated node
 * (numbered from 1 to the requested nodecount nPEs) with the given message
 * tag. Length 0 is allowed and leads to a message containing no payload data.
 * The send action may fail, in which case false is returned, and the
 * caller is expected to handle this situation.
 * Data length should be given in bytes, data will be sent raw
 * (unsigned char).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   IN node     -- destination node, number between 1 and nPEs
 *   IN tag      -- message tag
 *   IN data     -- array of raw data (unsigned char values) to send out
 *   IN length   -- length of data array. Allowed to be zero (no data).
 * Returns:
 *   bool: success or failure inside comm. subsystem

 * Effect:
 *   A message is received from a peer.
 *   Data are received as unsigned char values and stored in
 *   destination (capacity given in Bytes), and opcode and sender
 *   fields set.
 *   If no messages were waiting, the method blocks until a
 *   message is available. If too much data arrives (> maxlength),
 *   the program stops with an error (resp. of higher levels).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   IN  maxlength   -- maximum data length (in bytes)
 *   IN  destination -- where to unpack data (unsigned char array)
 *   OUT code   -- OpCode of message (aka message tag)
 *   OUT sender -- originator of this message
